# Probabilistic Linear Solvers and Their Applications

Practical session held at the Probabilistic Numerics Spring School 2024

## Setup

To participate in this tutorial, you will need a fresh Python 3.11 virtual environment or a (mini)conda installation.

**virtual environment:**
Activate the environment, and run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the repository to install all necessary requirements.

**(mini)conda:**
Run `conda env create -f environment.yml` in the repository.
This will create a new conda env named `pn-school-linalg` with the correct Python version and all necessary requirements installed automatically.

In either case, activate the (conda/virtual) environment, run `jupyter lab`, and navigate to the tutorial notebook.
